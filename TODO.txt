Make it work:
	- Implement schema access @done
	The bit that actually talks to Cassandra.
	- Implement activity feed protocol @done
	Exposes subscribe/unsubscribe, publish/unpublish, activity, object verbs.
	- Build HTTP service on protocol @done
	- Build client API for service	 @done
	- Build AR sugar on top of client API @done
Global timeline:
	- Import users and spots, some % of checkins
	Script importer to convert from PG to CL
	- Add feature flipper
	- Publish non-private checkins to Chronologic
	- Connect firehose to global timeline
	- Set up Cassandra staging cluster
	2-4 node cluster, smaller instances. Used for testing load, adding/removing nodes, etc.	
	- Spike out logging
	Look into rsyslog or scribe for aggregating logs.
	- Start smoke tests
Region timelines:
	- Subscribe regions to spots in the right WOE
	- Add feature flipper
	- Publish non-private checkins to spot timelines
	- Use region timeline on region pages
	- Spike out instrumentation and Ganglia monitoring
	Track update, read times, transaction volume. Would be nice to track HTTP caching as well.
Item timelines:
	- Add feature flipper
	- Publish bonuses, drops, swaps, and vaults to item timelines
	- Use item timeline on time pages
	- Add pagination to Chronologic
	Can will_paginate work smoothly with this, or will we need something duck-type compatible?
Spot timelines:
	- Add feature flipper
	- Publish drops, swaps, bonuses, highlights and photos to spot timelines as subevents
	- Use spot timeline on spot pages
	- Add tombstones to Chronologic
	- Build merged/deleted spot logic on top of tombstones
	- Spike out privacy checking for showing private checkins to permitted users
	Move privacy checks out of views and controllers and into Chronologic client library
User timelines:
	- Add feature flipper
	- Import friend relationships as subscriptions
	- Publish checkins, photos, comments to user timelines
	- Use user timeline on passport page
	- Use subscriber timeline on home page
Finish:
	- Remove feature flippers
	- Remove old activity code
	- Fill out documentation for writing to activity feeds and creating different timelines
	- Celebrate
